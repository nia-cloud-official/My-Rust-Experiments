# 🦀 My Rust Experiments

Welcome to my personal Rust playground!

I'm learning Rust by experimenting with different ideas, building random components, and breaking stuff on purpose — until I become a Rust pro. 💪

This repo contains small apps, components, and experiments built with Rust (mostly using [`yew`](https://yew.rs) for frontend stuff).

---

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here

- 🧪 Fun experiments with `yew`
- 🔧 Custom Rust components
- 🧠 Random logic and pattern testing
- 💥 Mistakes I’ve learned from

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Get comfortable with Rust syntax and tooling  
- Build cool and weird stuff to master the language  
- Eventually create real apps using Rust for frontend and backend  

---

## 💻 How to Run (Yew)

To try out a component:

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nia-cloud-official/My-Rust-Experiments.git
   cd My-Rust-Experiments
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cargo install trunk
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   trunk serve
   ```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## 🧠 Still Learning...

This project is all about **learning in public** — it might be messy now, but progress is progress!

Feel free to fork, clone, or open issues if you want to chat Rust.

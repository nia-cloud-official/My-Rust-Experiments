# ğŸ¦€ My Rust Experiments

Welcome to my personal Rust playground!

I'm learning Rust by experimenting with different ideas, building random components, and breaking stuff on purpose â€” until I become a Rust pro. ğŸ’ª

This repo contains small apps, components, and experiments built with Rust (mostly using [`yew`](https://yew.rs) for frontend stuff).

---

## ğŸ“š What Youâ€™ll Find Here

- ğŸ§ª Fun experiments with `yew`
- ğŸ”§ Custom Rust components
- ğŸ§  Random logic and pattern testing
- ğŸ’¥ Mistakes Iâ€™ve learned from

---

## ğŸš€ Goals

- Get comfortable with Rust syntax and tooling  
- Build cool and weird stuff to master the language  
- Eventually create real apps using Rust for frontend and backend  

---

## ğŸ§  Still Learning...

This project is all about **learning in public** â€” it might be messy now, but progress is progress!

Feel free to fork, clone, or open issues if you want to chat Rust.

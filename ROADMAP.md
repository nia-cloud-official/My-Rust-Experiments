# 🗺️ Rust Learning Roadmap

This roadmap tracks my journey from Rust newbie to Rust ninja 🥷🦀

Every step includes mini goals and experiments to help me grow while having fun breaking (and fixing) stuff.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Getting Comfortable with the Basics

> Goal: Understand core Rust concepts and syntax

- [x] Variables, types, and ownership
- [x] Functions and control flow
- [x] Structs, enums, and pattern matching
- [x] Basic error handling
- [x] Vectors, strings, and slices
- [x] Creating and calling modules

---

## 🧪 Phase 2: Playing with Yew (Rust Web Framework)

> Goal: Build interactive frontend UIs using Rust and Yew

- [x] Setup a `yew` project with `trunk`
- [x] Build and render basic HTML components
- [x] Create reusable structs and props
- [x] Handle button clicks and events
- [ ] Create dynamic lists (e.g. users, todos)
- [ ] Integrate routing
- [ ] Play with form inputs and two-way binding

---

## 🔄 Phase 3: Backend + API (WIP)

> Goal: Start combining frontend & backend logic in Rust

- [ ] Learn and experiment with `actix-web` or `axum`
- [ ] Build a small REST API (CRUD)
- [ ] Connect Yew frontend to Rust backend via fetch
- [ ] Add basic auth (JWT or sessions)

---

## 🧠 Bonus Experiments (Always Adding)

- [ ] Use Rust to build a CLI tool
- [ ] Explore `tokio` and async runtimes
- [ ] Try compiling to WebAssembly (WASM)
- [ ] Connect with a database (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Deploy to Netlify or GitHub Pages (for frontend)

---

## 🌟 Ultimate Goal

> To be able to build **fullstack apps in Rust** that are fast, efficient, and fun to code!
